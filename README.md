# Welcome to my first steps in react-native development

This is a simple app that shows a list of items and allows you to add new items to the list, deactivate them and delete them ultimately.
I built this without any tutorials, as I'm proficient in React JS and would like to see how far i get with just documentation and google. 
This is the first time i'm learning a new framework without any tutorials - I'm enjoying it so far.
